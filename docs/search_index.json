The DADA2 pipeline was first applied to create an amplicon sequence variant table based upon microbial sequencing data taken from patients recovering from leukemia. Principal Coordinates Analysis was then applied to create ordination plots that represented the distribution of microbiome compositions. Interactive visualizations were developed in Tableau to visualize trends in the microbial dynamics of patients. Summary statistics to measure microbiome dynamics were also devised, and simple linear regressions were performed to identify potential traits related to changes in the microbiome over time. These analyses suggested a connection between microbiome movement and vital status and graft source. Finally, a phylogenetic tree decomposition was conducted to create a transformation of the bacterial abundance data that would provide contextual insight into links between patient traits and their microbiomes. Through this process, we found that variables including care environment, the presence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease, graft source, diagnosis, and transplant type are all potentially significantly related to the composition of patient gut bacteria. Ultimately, our methodology shows much promise for the identification of connections between patient recovery from leukemia and their gut microbiomes. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction A large variety of microorganisms live within the human body, constituting the “human microbiome.” Despite representing on average just 2% of the human body’s mass, these microbes play an important role in human health, outnumbering human cells at a ratio of almost ten to one (NIH 2012). While they often serve mutualistic roles, many microorganisms are also associated with various kinds of disease. In collaboration with Dr. Tony Sung and Alex Sibley in the Duke University School of Medicine, we made use of data collected from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on patients recovering from blood cancer. These individuals had all been diagnosed with some form of leukemia, and had then been provided with stem cell transplants in an effort to combat the cancerous blood cells. These individuals also recovered after their transplants in different locations, including houses, apartments, and clinics. Throughout the treatment process, stool samples were supplied by the patients. These samples were then sequenced by Memorial Sloan Kettering. The goal of this study, using these microbial sequencing data, was threefold: 1) better understand the filtration process that goes into the processing, filtration, and cleaning of microbiome sequencing data. 2) devise effective, interactive visualizations for the dynamics of microbiome compositions. 3) apply statistical methodology to identify potential associations between factors in recovery from leukemia and the microbiome.

["1-pre-processing-of-microbiome-sequencing-data.html", "Chapter 1 Pre-processing of Microbiome Sequencing Data", " Chapter 1 Pre-processing of Microbiome Sequencing Data Microbiome data can be procured from a multitude of sample types, including skin, the vagina, and the gut. Taken immediately from a wet-lab experiment, microbiome data starts off simply as a collection of FASTQ reads, each representing different bacterial sequences identified within the sample. Identification and clustering of these reads is required to produce a representation of microbiome data that can be effectively used for data analysis.The classic format of these processed data is known as the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) table. These tables group DNA sequences into “molecular operational taxonomic units, clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity threshold” (Callahan 2017). Each row in the table represents a sample, and each column represents a different OTU. In the past couple of years, new methods have allowed researchers to work with amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) instead of OTUs. ASV groupings can be “resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region,” allowing for improved resolution of processed data (Callahan 2017). The DADA2 pipeline in R can be used to process microbiome sequence data and create an ASV table, yielding “more real variants and output[ting] fewer spurious sequences than other methods” (Callahan 2016). As an exploration of the use of the DADA2 pipeline for the processing of microbiome sequencing data, we used the European Nucleotide Archive (Harrison 2018) to download raw read data from Catherine Lozupone’s 2013 study on gut-linked diseases prevalent in HIV (Lozupone 2013). With these data, we applied Benjamin Callahan’s 2016 paper, “Bioconductor Workflow for Microbiome Analysis: from raw reads to community analyses,” to manipulate the Lozupone sequencing data. With this pipeline, we visualized the fastq quality scores of our read files (Figure 1.1) 1.1 to trim our input reads at ideal positions. We also filtered reads through the enforcement of a maximum of 2 expected errors per read. Figure 1.1: Fastq quality scores for a sample read file Following the filtration of input reads, we used DADA2 to infer ASVs. Demultiplexed, dereplicated fastq files were selected for each sample. A sufficiently large subset of our data was taken, and then the DADA2 iterative sequence inference algorithm was run to estimate error rates. We inspected the fit between observed error rates and fitted error rates to verify that our estimations were reasonable (Figure 1.2) 1.2 Figure 1.2: Comparison of observed and fitted error rates from the DADA2 iterative sequence inference algorithm Using inference on pooled sequencing reads from all samples, DADA2 then removed nearly all substition and indel errors from our data. Finally, a sequence table was constructed from our sequences. Just as processing of sequencing data was completed for the Lozupone dataset, Alex Sibley, a bioinformatician working with the Sung lab in the Duke School of Medicine, created an ASV table using the Memorial Sloan Kettering leukemia data. Given these data, we continued through the Callahan workflow to further filter and process our data. "],
["2-post-processing-and-filtration-of-the-sequence-table.html", "Chapter 2 Post-processing and Filtration of the Sequence Table", " Chapter 2 Post-processing and Filtration of the Sequence Table The ASV table produced by Alex Sibley consisted of seven different bathces of stool samples produced by MSK. These distinct tables were merged into a single ASV table, with columns representing different ASVs, rows representing sampling, and counts in the table representing the abundance of each ASV in each of our samples. DADA2 was used to remove chimeric sequences from the sequence table by comparing each inferred sequence to others in the table, and removing those that could be reproduced by stitching together two more abundant sequences. The DADA2 naive Bayesian classifier was then used to compare sequence variants to the RDP v14 training set of classified sequences (Cole 2013). Through this process, each ASV column is assigned a full taxonomy, including Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus. In addition to assigning taxonomies, we associated deidentified metadata to our stool samples, also provided to us by Memorial Sloan Kettering. The metadata were imported, cleaned, and subsetted to match our ASV table. Finally, the R “phyloseq” package was applied to combine our ASV feature table, our metadata, and our sequence taxonomies of our amplicon sequencing experiment into a single object (McMurdle 2013). With our full phyloseq object, we then used our assigned taxonomies as a filtering criterion on our data. This filtration process helps us to avoid spending unneeded time on taxa that are seen too infrequently and eliminates extra noise by deleting taxa that are simply artifacts of data collection. We created a table of read counts for each Phylum present in our dataset. Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child Phyla Read Counts Actinobacteria 3864 Armatimonadetes 1 Bacteroidetes 3375 Chlamydiae 3 Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast 15 Deferribacteres 1 Deinococcus-Thermus 3 Euryarchaeota 2 Firmicutes 155578 Fusobacteria 19 Proteobacteria 3481 Spirochaetes 4 Synergistetes 84 Tenericutes 3 Verrumicrobia 8823 Woesearchaeota 1578 211134 Many of our features are annotated with a phylum of “NA,” potentially indicating that they are artifacts. However, due to the fact that databases such as the RDP are often far from complete, filtering out all of these datapoints was considered to be too stringent. As a result, they were kept in our dataset. We also explored feature prevalence in our dataset. Feature prevalence is defined to be the number of samples in which a taxum appears at least once. We computed the average and total prevalences of the features in each phylum to determine if there were any phyla that consisted mostly of low-prevalence features. Feature Prevalence of Phyla in our Dataset Phylum Average Abundance Total Abundance Actinobacteria 2.612319 10094 Armatimonadetes 1.000000 1 Bacteroidetes 3.135111 10581 Chlamydiae 1.000000 3 Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast 3.133333 47 Deferribacteres 7.000000 7 Deinococcus-Thermus 2.333333 7 Euryarchaeota 25.000000 50 Firmicutes 1.952770 303808 Fusobacteria 4.473684 85 Proteobacteria 3.381212 11770 Spirochaetes 1.500000 6 Synergistetes 1.880952 158 Tenericutes 2.333333 7 Verrucomicrobia 1.706562 15057 Woesearchaeota 3.147022 4966 1.977450 417507 Through this process, we dropped the following phyla from our dataset: Armatimonadetes, Chlamydiae, Deferribacteres, Deinococcus-Thermus, Spirochaetes, and Tenericutes The previous filtration steps required our taxonomic annotations to properly work. Without taxonomies, we can use prevalence filtering as a form of unsupervised filtration to further streamline our data. We plotted graphs of prevalence against total abundance for each phylum in an effort to identify an appropriate prevalence threshold (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Feature Prevalence of Phyla against Total Abundance in our Dataset We failed to see see any real separation in our plots, so we established an arbitrary prevalence threshold of 1%. In order to account for differences in library size, variance, and scale, we had to use relative abundances instead of total abundances. We transformed our data from counts to frequencies, and also applied a log transformation. We then applied Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to our transformed data. We visualized ordination plots of the samples in our dataset, as well as of the distribution of taxa present in each sample (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Ordination Plots of Samples and of Phyla In addition to looking at the specific distribution of phyla for our samples, we can color-code the different datapoints representing each of our samples to determine if there are any obvious clustering patterns based upon the covariates in our metadata. In the following two plots, we visualize vital status and graft source for our patients across all time points (Figures 2.3 and 2.4). Figure 2.3: Ordination Plot of Samples, colored by Vital Status Figure 2.4: Ordination Plot of Samples, colored by Graft Source While these visualizations revealed some information into the distributions of bacteria in our samples, we failed to see any obvious trends across our categories. Another key issue with our plots is that we were unable to clearly identify how a single patient’s sample would change over time. To quantify the dynamics of a patient’s microbiome in our ordination plot, we devised two different summary statistics: maximum distance and last distance. We began by creating a Scree plot to determine the contributions of our different principal coordinate axes (Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5: Scree Plot of Contributions from PCoA Axes Analyzing the plot and computing the contributions of our axes, we see that the first 17 axes constitute the the majority of contributions from our 460 total axes. So, we used these axes as part of our distance metrics; we calculated the distance from one sample to another by taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences of each of our seventeen components. Given an individual patient in our dataset, maximum distance is defined as the furthest distance in the ordination plot traveled from the patient’s earliest point. Last distance is defined as the distance between the individual’s earliest and latest point in the ordination plot. A potential future avenue to explore in this scenario is to scale principal components relative to one another instead of simply using the first seventeen, in an effort to get a better quantification of our two metrics. With our processed dataset and ordination plot, and our new summary statistics, we turned to the visualization application “Tableau.” "],
["3-interactive-visualizations-in-tableau.html", "Chapter 3 Interactive Visualizations in Tableau", " Chapter 3 Interactive Visualizations in Tableau Tableau is a user-friendly application helpful in the design of interactive visualizations. We used this application to visualize the our data over time in our ordination plots and determine if there were any noticeable associations between variables in our metadata and the dynamics of our samples. In each Tableau sheet created, hovering over a single point will cause that sample, as well as all other samples corresponding to the same patient, to be highlighted. This behavior allows us to specifically visualize how our samples’ distributions change on an individual basis. Figures 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 include some examples of the plots designed in Tableau. Figure 3.1 depicts an ordination plot, colored by Batch number, and connected by patient ID. The thickness of lines connecting points to one another increases as time progresses. Hovering over a point will also highlight other sample points and the path representative of the selected patient. Figure 3.1: Ordination Plot colored by Batch Number and connected by Patient ID Figure 3.2 shows plots of the maximum distance travelled by different patients, separated by whether or not their first sample date occurred before or after their transplant. It appears roughly that patients with first time points occurring before transplant date may have potentially higher maximum distances. Figure 3.2: Plots of Maximum Distance traveled by Patient Microbiome Figure 3.3 depicts two ordination plots colored by presence of acute graft versus host disease. The top plot depicts agvhd values taken within the twelve weeks prior to transplants, and the second plot depicts agvhd values taken within the twelve weeks after. Both plots can be manipulated to specify the desired time frame. This kind of visualization allows us to more directly compare the distributions of our covariates at different times. Figure 3.3: Ordination Plots colored by AGVHD, separated by Time With all of these plots, we were better able to interact with our data and the metrics that we had devised. However, while these visualizations were informative, we were still unable to specifically quantify potential associations between our various covariates and the dynamics of the gut microbiome. "],
["4-linear-regression-on-summary-statistics.html", "Chapter 4 Linear Regression on Summary Statistics", " Chapter 4 Linear Regression on Summary Statistics With the processing and filtration of our data, as well as its visualization in Tableau, we turned to basic linear regressions as well as non-parametric statistical tests to attempt to evaluate how our covariates may be linked to the dynamics of the microbiome. Based upon exploratory data analysis, we kept all of our continuous variables untransformed. There were no extremely concerning trends in any of our categorical variables either, so we did not transform them. There was also no need to transform the outcome variable of maximum distance. We used lattice plots to search for interaction effects across our categorical variables, as well as boxplots to search for connections between categorical and quantitatie covariates. Identified interactions were included in our baseline model. Backwards selection was then performed using AIC as a scoring criterion. For maximum distance as the outcome, our final model with the lowest AIC based on backward selection came out to be as follows: \\(maxDistance_{i} = {\\beta_{transplantAge}}transplantAge_{i} + {\\beta_{AlloDLI}}I(transplantType_{i}=AlloDLI) + {\\beta_{Auto}}I(transplantType_{i}=Auto) +{\\beta_{Cord}}I(graftSource_{i}=Cord) + {\\beta_{PBPC}}I(graftSource_{i}=PBPC) + {\\beta_{Dead}}I(vitalStatus_{i}=Dead) + {\\beta_{CGVHD}}I(CGVHD_{i}=1)+ {\\beta_{anc500}}anc500_{i} + {\\beta_{careEnv2}}I(careEnv_{i}=2) + {\\beta_{careEnv3}}I(careEnv_{i}=3) + {\\beta_{totalTimeSpan}}totalTimeSpan_{i} + {\\beta_{vitalStatus/careEnv2}}I(vitalStatus/careEnv2_{i}=1) + {\\beta_{vitalStatus/careEnv3}}I(vitalStatus/careEnv3_{i}=1)\\) This model had an AIC of -34.11267, and it identified the following covariates as significant: Significant P-values from linear regression with max distance as outcome Covariate P-value Age at Transplant 0.06975 Graft Source (Cord Blood) 0.00173 Vital Status (Dead) 0.07956 Total Time Span 0.09064 Vital Status(Dead)/Care Environment(2) 0.06164 Our assumptions for equality of subpopulation standard deviations, as well as that our samples came from a normally distributed population, are fulfilled by the residual plot and normal QQ-plot for our data. We repeated the same backward selection process as above, but this time, we used last distance as our outcome variable. Based on backward selection according to AIC, we came up with the following model: \\(lastDistance_{i} = {\\beta_{Black}}I(race_{i}=Black) +{\\beta_{MoreThanOne}}I(race_{i}=MoreThanOne) + {\\beta_{White}}I(race_{i}=White) + {\\beta_{hispanicUnk}}I(hispanic_{i}=Unk) + {\\beta_{hispanicYes}}I(hispanic_{i}=Yes)+ {\\beta_{Cord}}I(graftSource_{i}=Cord) + {\\beta_{PBPC}}I(graftSource_{i}=PBPC) + {\\beta_{Dead}}I(vitalStatus_{i}=Dead) + {\\beta_{CGVHD}}I(CGVHD_{i}=1) + {\\beta_{totalTimeSpan}}totalTimeSpan_{i}\\) Our model had an AIC of -32.37633, and identified the following variables as significant. Significant P-values from linear regression with last distance as outcome Covariate P-value Race (Black) 0.05396 Graft Source (Cord Blood) 0.00569 Vital Status (Dead) 0.03409 Total Time Span 0.04429 In addition to performing linear regressions for our two summary statistics, we also applied various non-parametric tests, in the hope that they would provide further insight into variables that may be significant for our two metrics. While these tests are not necessarily as useful as regression analyses due to the fact that they do not take into account the context from multiple variables, they can still be potentially informative. Performing these tests for our maximum distance metric, we see that graft source appears to be significant. P-values from non-parametric statistical tests for maximum distance as outcome Covariate P-value Chronic Graft vs Host Disease 0.3492 Acute Graft vs Host Disease 0.3611 Gender 0.6318 Vital Status 0.1448 initialNegative 0.6797 Batch 0.4793 Race 0.3308 Hispanic 0.1481 Diagnosis 0.9087 Transplant Type 0.2799 Transplant Response 0.6978 Graft Source 0.0105 Care Environment 0.6004 When we perform these same tests for our last distance metric, we see that none of our variables are significant.

To deal with this possible high sensitivity to data, we decided to make use of a more creative method for modeling the abundances of ASVs in our data. "],
["5-phylogenetic-tree-decomposition.html", "Chapter 5 Phylogenetic Tree Decomposition", " Chapter 5 Phylogenetic Tree Decomposition There are several aspects of microbiome data that make statistical analysis difficult. Potential issues include high dimensionality with large numbers of OTUs, sparsity due to small OTU counts, and potential correlations among counts of different OTUs. These aspects can cause problems when attempting to perform inference on the abundances of taxonomic units. Furthermore, simply analyzing regression results for a single OTU at a time fails to take into account the dependencies between different bacterial populations in the gut. To address these concerns, we applied a Phylogenetic Tree Decomposition to our microbiome data. This methodology replicates concepts introduced in PhyloScan (Tang 2018) and DTM (Wang 2017). Using a phylogenetic tree can summarize the evolutionary relationships amongst the OTUs, allowing us to have a better context of their functional relationships and enriching the overall model fitting process. With our completed filtration of our samples, we constructed a phylogenetic tree to represent the relations between our samples. We used the DECIPHER package in R to first perform multiple-alignment on the sequences in our ASV sequence table (Wright 2016). We then used the R package “phangorn” to fit a UPGMA tree based upon our sequences (Schliep 2018). Our full tree was a binary tree with a single root node. There were a total of 11048 leaf nodes, and 11047 internal nodes. Our filtered ASV table has a total of 462 rows, each corresponding to a distinct sample. Each column in our ASV table represents a leaf in the phylogenetic tree. With these initial abundances for a given sample, we propagated our way up through the phylogenetic tree, determining the counts going left and right at each of our 11047 internal node. This process was repeated 462 times, once per sample. Figure 5.1 provides a smaller example of the phylogenetic tree transformation process. The code to achieve this transformation was implemented in Python, and took roughly two weeks to finish running. Figure 5.1: An example of bottom-up propagation of abundance counts In addition to using calculating counts going left and right at each internal node, code was also written in Python to determine the taxonomic rankings of each internal node, based upon the assigned taxonomies from the RDP for each ASV column in the sequence table. Figure 5.2 provides a smaller example of this propagation process. Figure 5.2: An example of bottom-up propagation of Taxonomies With calculated counts and taxonomies for each of the internal nodes of our phylogenetic tree, we then applied a logit mixed-effect binomial model to each one, using the “glmer” function of the R “lme4” package (Bates 2015). At each node, we had 370 observations after filtration for missing values. There were a total of 129 different patients in our dataset. We incorporated a random effect for patient ID, and a nested random effect within patientID for sampleDate. We also included fixed effects for Batch number, transplant Age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, transplant type, graft source, vital status, care environment, presence of acute graft v. host disease, presence of chronic graft v. host disease, ANC500 level, and “preOrPost,” telling us if the first sample was taken before or after the transplant date. The general format of our mixed effects model is as follows: \\(logit(P_{i}(A)) = X_{i}\\beta^{(A)} + \\gamma_{i}^{(A)} + \\epsilon_{it}^{(A)}\\) \\(P_{i}(A)\\) is the probability of picking the left child of node A for sample \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). \\(\\gamma_{i}^{(A)} = N(0, \\sigma_{\\gamma}^{2})\\) \\(\\epsilon_{i}^{(A)} = N(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2})\\) \\(for \\ i = 1,...,370\\) In most cases, the regression model would fail to converge and provide meaningful results. However, there were twenty-two different internal nodes for which our model finished running and identified different variables to be significant. There were also several instances where Batch effects were noticed, including four nodes where the only significant variable was Batch number. The eighteen nodes that identified significant variables other than Batch are detailed in the table below, providing their taxonomy, the taxonomies of their children, and the significant covariates at their node.

["conclusion.html", "Conclusion", " Conclusion Overall, our work from this year gave us much insight into the methodology required to understand and process microbiome data, as well as revealed the potential behind new methodologies for the visualization and analysis of associations between patient information and microbiome compositions. In terms of future directions for our project, there are many avenues that we can take. With respect to processing, we can investigate the use of different filtration parameters in our initial generation of our ASV table. For visualizations and simple linear regressions, we could also try to determine new summary statistics that still effectively represent the dynamics of the microbiome over time, but are less resistant to the addition and deletion of data. With respect to our phylogenetic tree decomposition, it would be useful to repeat our procedure with either fewer variables in our mixed effects model, or with more data. We see that our results are relatively sparse, particularly at nodes that occur lower in our phylogenetic tree. With more data, our counts would be higher at a larger number of internal nodes, thus giving us the ability to fit regression models for more than just twenty-two of them. With more results, we could also analyze the output of our regression along chains of related nodes, thus controlling for inter-node variation. There is also potential that functionality instead of phylogeny might be a better way to characterize the relations between microbiota. Instead of building a tree solely based upon taxonomies, it would also be interesting to use a tree based upon microbial functional groups instead, to have a clearer indication of the relationship between microbiome functions. Ultimately, our methodology shows much promise for the identification of connections between patient recovery from leukemia and their microbiomes. "],
